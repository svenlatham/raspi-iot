This agent is a basic phone detector. It works by looking for phone wifi signals. We simply count the number of unique devices.

It's worth noting this is a very crude way of counting people (at very low cost, so there is some balance).

Accuracy is low - particularly with MAC Scrambling now in use - that these sensors are best at describing "busier than usual" rather than actual numbers of people.

Short-term trends tend to be reasonably stable, but this technology is not ideal for longer term analysis (year-on-year, for instance).
